Exif parsing library written in pure Rust
-----------------------------------------

   This is a pure-Rust library to parse Exif data.
   This library can parse TIFF and JPEG images and extract Exif
   attributes.

Usage
-----

   Add a dependency entry to your Cargo.toml.  Specifying at least two
   numbers is recommended because, during the major version 0, the
   minor will be bumped to indicate backwards-incompatible changes.

      [dependencies]
      exif = "0.3"

   Add the following to your crate root.

      extern crate exif;

Dependencies
------------

   Rust 1.20 or later is required to build.

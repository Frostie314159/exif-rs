// This is not an enum to keep safety and API stability, while
// supporting unknown tag values.  This comment is based on the
// behavior of Rust 1.12.
// Storing unknown values in a repr(u16) enum is unsafe.  The compiler
// assumes that there is no undefined discriminant even with a C-like
// enum, so the exhaustiveness check of a match expression will break.
// Storing unknown values in a special variant such as Unknown(u16)
// tends to break backward compatibility.  When Tag::VariantFoo is
// defined in a new version of the library, the old codes using
// Tag::Unknown(Foo's value) will break.

/// A tag of a TIFF field.
